Write a Java program that asks user to enter a number
if number is dividable by 5 then finish the program but if number is not dividable by 5,
keep asking user to enter a new number until user enters a number that is dividable by 5
Ask user to enter a number while their number is not divided by 5

Do _______________________while

Example program:
Program: Please enter a number
User: 3
Program: This number is not dividable by 5

Program: Please enter a  number
User: 10
Program: This number is dividable by 5
